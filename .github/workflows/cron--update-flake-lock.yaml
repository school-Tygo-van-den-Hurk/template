            deps: updated Nix flake inputs

            This is an automated commit to keep the flake inputs up to date.
            Why is it important to keep Nix dependencies up to date you may
            ask? Nixpkgs receives a continuous stream of security patches to
            keep your software and systems secure. Using outdated revisions of
            Nixpkgs can inadvertently expose you to software security risks
            that have been resolved in more recent releases. That is why we
            use the unstable branch, and update it regularly.
